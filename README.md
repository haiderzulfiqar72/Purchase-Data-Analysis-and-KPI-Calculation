# Purchase-Data-Analysis-and-KPI-Calculation
 Following is a comprehensive data analysis project that leverages SQL and Python to analyze purchase data for Wolt, calculating the profitability of each purchase and generating key performance indicators (KPIs) for crucial insights.

The analysis begins with SQL queries to create a derived table, calculating the profitability of each purchase. Advanced SQL concepts like temp tables and CTEs are employed, ensuring accuracy and efficiency. A scalable solution is designed to handle potential errors in the dataset and accommodate future data, enhancing the project's robustness and adaptability.

The calculated KPIs include identifying the top 10 venues with the highest margins, as well as the top 5 countries based on average order size, order value, and volume. These KPIs provide valuable insights into the most profitable venues and regions, enabling strategic decision-making for the business.

Python's Seaborn library is utilized to create visually appealing and insightful visualizations. Bar plots showcase the top venues and countries, while a line plot illustrates the monthly cumulative Woltwide margin, revealing the business's global profitability trends over time.

The combination of SQL analysis and Python visualizations forms a strong foundation for the project's findings. It enhances the project's communicative power, enabling stakeholders to gain a clear understanding of margins, order size, and overall profitability. The project aims to empowers businesses with data-driven decision-making, fostering growth and success for Wolt in the highly competitive market.
